# Autonomous-Quad
This repository contains all my codes that I experimented for doing my final year project on autonomous quadcopter. It mostly containts what I learnt from Joop Brokking who has a youtube channel on DIY drones. 
Key skills acquired: 
1. Reading register maps of Atmega 320p
2. Coding duty cycles in Arduino
3. How to troubleshoot an embedded program in C
4. MPU6050 Gyroscope and Accelerometer
5. Adding interrupt subroutine
